# Personal Polkadot Arbitrage Agent

## Problem Statement
Price discrepancies exist across different parachains and centralized exchanges for DOT and parachain tokens, creating arbitrage opportunities that are currently underexploited due to complexity and speed requirements. Individual traders lack sophisticated tools to exploit these opportunities efficiently.

## Proposed Solution
A personal arbitrage agent software that runs locally, using your own capital to monitor price differences across Polkadot ecosystem exchanges and execute profitable trades automatically. No fund management, no regulatory complexity - just intelligent software for personal trading.

## Key Features
- **Personal Trading Agent**: Runs locally on your machine using your own API keys and capital
- **Real-time Price Monitoring**: Track DOT prices across major CEXs (Binance, Coinbase, Kraken) and DEXs (Polkadex, HydraDX)
- **Cross-Chain Bridge Integration**: Utilize XCM for seamless parachain token transfers
- **Intelligent Risk Management**: Dynamic position sizing based on your risk tolerance and capital
- **Automated Execution**: Execute trades with your personal exchange accounts
- **Claude Flow Integration**: AI agents that learn and optimize your trading strategies
- **Zero Custody**: Your funds never leave your control - agent operates through your API keys

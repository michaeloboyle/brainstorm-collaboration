# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is a **collaboration repository** between Michael O'Boyle and Bruno Galv√£o for brainstorming and developing innovative project ideas, particularly focused on Polkadot ecosystem and Web3 technologies. The repository serves as a shared workspace for concept development and collaborative exploration.

## Repository Structure

- `/ideas/` - Initial concepts and brainstorms (primary content area)
- `/projects/` - Developed project specifications (empty, available for future development)
- `/experiments/` - Quick prototypes and proofs of concept (empty, available for prototyping)
- `/resources/` - Shared references and inspiration (empty, available for resource collection)

## Key Architecture Patterns

### Idea Documentation Standard
All ideas follow a structured template defined in `/ideas/README.md`:
- Problem Statement
- Proposed Solution
- Key Features
- System Architecture (with Mermaid diagrams)
- Technical Considerations
- Next Steps

### Visual Documentation Approach
This repository emphasizes comprehensive **Mermaid diagram usage** for all system designs:
- System Architecture diagrams showing component relationships
- Sequence diagrams for process flows
- Pie charts for resource allocation and strategy distribution
- Process flows for decision trees and workflow logic

### Current Focus Areas
The repository currently contains four major concept areas:
1. **Polkadot Cross-Chain Arbitrage System** - Personal automated trading agents
2. **Cross-Parachain DeFi Yield Aggregator** - Yield optimization across Polkadot DeFi
3. **Parachain Analytics Platform** - Ecosystem analytics and governance insights
4. **XCM Developer Toolkit** - Cross-chain development tools

## Collaboration Workflow

### File Organization
- Use descriptive file names in kebab-case (e.g., `polkadot-arbitrage-system.md`)
- Each idea gets its own dedicated markdown file
- Maintain comprehensive Mermaid diagrams for all architectural concepts

### Documentation Standards
- Include system architecture diagrams for complex ideas
- Use sequence diagrams to illustrate step-by-step processes
- Employ pie charts for allocation strategies and resource distribution
- Follow the idea template structure consistently

### Version Control Practice
- Use descriptive commit messages
- Create issues for major discussions
- Tag collaborators for feedback (@michaeloboyle @brunopgalvao)
- Keep ideas organized and well-documented

## Development Notes

This repository currently contains **no build tools, package managers, or code execution environments** - it is purely a documentation and brainstorming workspace. When ideas mature into actual implementations:

1. Move detailed specifications to `/projects/`
2. Create prototypes in `/experiments/`
3. Collect supporting materials in `/resources/`
4. Consider creating separate implementation repositories for each mature project

## Special Characteristics

- **Personal/Collaborative Focus**: Ideas are developed for personal use and collaboration, not commercial ventures
- **Polkadot Ecosystem Emphasis**: Heavy focus on Polkadot, parachains, XCM, and Web3 Foundation technologies
- **AI Integration**: Several concepts incorporate Claude Flow AI and intelligent agent systems
- **Cross-Chain Innovation**: Emphasis on cross-parachain functionality and XCM utilization
